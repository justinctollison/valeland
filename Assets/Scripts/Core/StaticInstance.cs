using UnityEngine;


/* A collection of classes to be inherited from to make organization and referencing of some classes easier.
 * Inheriting from any of these classes allows that class to be referenced as (ClassName).Instance
 * ex. PauseMenuManager.Instance.Open()
 * This would open the pause menu as long as an object with the PauseMenuManager component is in the scene,
 * However only one PauseMenuManager can exist at one time.
 * These classes are taken from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE1qH8OxO2Y&t=635s
